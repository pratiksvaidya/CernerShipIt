We created Silver for the Cerner Intern Hackathon in order to simplify prescription management, especially for patients with a large number of medications. 

Silver allows clients to keep track of a large list of medications and find affordable refills, while being informed about their medications shelf life.

## Features
- The application keeps track of all of the patientâ€™s medications.
- Shows the cheapest refills available in the surrounding area for the particular medication.
- Ability to scan prescriptions to auto-fill data.
- Offers alerts for expired medications.
- Privacy/security features
